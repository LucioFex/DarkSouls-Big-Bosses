### This is a compilation of the main bosses from Dark Souls 1 and their counterparts in the second game.

<p>You can move between the bosses within a 3D interface, to see a little about their lore.<br>
The boss sections (Dark Souls 1 and 2) are separated by a button with the number `1` or `2` at the top of the page.</p>
